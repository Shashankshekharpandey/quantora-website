              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                A global fintech unicorn with 10M+ users was overwhelmed by support tickets.
                Traditional chatbots could only answer FAQs, forcing 80% of queries to human agents.
              </p>

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                Support costs were ballooning ($15M/year). Customers faced 48-hour wait times for simple actions
                like refund processing or account tier upgrades, leading to high churn.
              </p>

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                We built a Level 4 Autonomous Agent capable of executing complex workflows.
                It doesn't just chat; it authenticates users, checks eligibility, and performs write-actions
                directly in the core banking system.

                R&D scientists spent 40% of their time searching through 50 years of internal research papers,
                clinical trial logs, and FDA filings scattered across SharePoint and legacy drives.
              </p>

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                Critical insights were lost in "data silos," leading to redundant experiments and
                delayed drug discovery pipelines. Keyword search was useless for conceptual queries.

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                We deployed a secure, multi-modal RAG system indexing 15 million documents.
                It understands chemistry formulas, tables, and handwriting, allowing scientists to "chat" with their

                Managing a global supply chain involves thousands of variables: weather, tariffs, port congestion, and
                demand spikes.
                Human planners were overwhelmed by the complexity.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                Reactive decision-making led to massive detention/demurrage fees and stockouts.
                The company needed a system that could predict disruptions and <em>act</em> on them.

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                We built a "Digital Twin" of the supply chain powered by Reinforcement Learning agents.
                The system autonomously re-routes shipments and re-allocates inventory to optimize for cost and speed.

                costly returns and reputation damage.
              </p>
              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                Deployed an Edge AI computer vision system on the assembly line cameras to detect scratches, dents, and
                rust in real-time (30fps).
